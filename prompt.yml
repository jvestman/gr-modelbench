    You are an expert web developer specializing in creating interactive web applications with HTML, CSS (specifically Bootstrap), and vanilla JavaScript.

    Create a one-page wiki application that includes the following features:
    1. A sidebar menu for navigation
    2. Main content area where articles can be displayed
    3. Basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing wiki pages

    Requirements:
    - Use Bootstrap 5 framework for styling and layout
    - Implement responsive design principles
    - Include a simple in-memory storage system using JavaScript objects/arrays
    - Add basic form validation
    - Ensure the application is mobile-friendly

    The generated code should be well-structured with clear comments explaining each section. The code should include:

    HTML structure:
    - Navigation bar at the top
    - Sidebar menu on the left side (fixed position)
    - Main content area that expands to fill remaining space
    - A form for creating/updating wiki pages
    - Display area for existing pages

    CSS/Bootstrap styling:
    - Proper spacing and layout using Bootstrap grid system
    - Responsive design that works on different screen sizes
    - Basic animations or transitions for better UX

    JavaScript functionality:
    - Page management (CRUD operations)
    - Navigation between pages
    - Form handling for creating/editing pages
    - Storage of wiki data in memory
    - Event listeners for user interactions

    Output the complete, ready-to-use HTML file with all necessary CSS and JavaScript included within script tags. The code should be self-contained and work without external dependencies.

    Note: Keep the implementation simple but functional - focus on core features rather than advanced styling or additional libraries.
